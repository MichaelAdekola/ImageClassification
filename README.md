# Image Classification API

ImageClassification is a RESTFUL API that uses machine learning to classify an image. The API will allow users to upload an image and using a pre-trained model from google called inception_V3. Users are able to register or log in and get a limited token to use the API until exhausted. User login details are stored on a MongoDB database. Once an image is uploaded, API will return 5 predictions in order of accuracy as a JSON response.  

## Installation

1. cd to the directory where requirements.txt is located
2. activate your virtualenv

3. ```bash
   run: pip install -r requirements.txt in your shell
   ```

## Usage

```python
export FLASK_APP=app1.py

flask run
```
